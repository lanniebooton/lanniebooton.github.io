      <!-- ABOUT -->
      <section id="about">
        <h2 class="section-title">About</h2>
        <p class="text-block">
          Hailing from the UK and living in <span style="color: #8b1e3f;">NZ</span>, I am an award-winning multidisciplinary artist with <span style="color: #8b1e3f;">two decades of experience</span> across illustration, game development, teaching, television, short film, and sculpture. 
          <br>
          Though I'm a versatile creator and work in a wide range of styles, I have a love for horror art, fantasy, and sci-fi. Some of my biggest inspirations
          being Jim Henson, Tim Burton, H.R Giger, Jim Moir, and Yoshitaka Amano. 
          <br>
          I love to experiment and play with new mediums, and like many artists probably have a few too many hobbies. I'm <span style="color: #8b1e3f;">also a programmer</span> and have an interest in Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and a few programming languages that I use to
          make largely ridiculous games or tools. 
          <br>
          One day I'd love to get into tattooing and I suspect that'd be the next realm I explore when able! As it stands I currently work in the animation industry as a technical artist for television productions. Previously I have also worked in compositing/VFX, editing, storyboarding, and screenwriting.
